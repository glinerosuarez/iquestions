1. How is Apache Spark different from MapReduce?
Apache Spark

MapReduce

Spark processes data in batches as well as in real-time

MapReduce processes data in batches only

Spark runs almost 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce

Hadoop MapReduce is slower when it comes to large scale data processing

Spark stores data in the RAM i.e. in-memory. So, it is easier to retrieve it

Hadoop MapReduce data is stored in HDFS and hence takes a long time to retrieve the data

Spark provides caching and in-memory data storage

Hadoop is highly disk-dependent

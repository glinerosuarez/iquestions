Suppose you have the following dataset*, which is a list of leaders for all independent states in the world as outlined in Gleditsch and Ward.

With this data, for all leaders that have valid birth and death years, can you plot the life expectancy over time for these leaders?

Here I would probably recommend a box and whisker plot to show distributions over time in the same chart..

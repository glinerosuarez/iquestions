"""
Suppose you're given an array of integers, and a number x. Find the smallest subarray with a sum greater than the given value. Given the array, the array's length n, and the number x your function should return:

The length of the smallest subarray that has a sum greater than x
The actual subarray that has a sum greater than x
For example:


 # Given the following


 array = [5,6,2,3,8]


 x = 12





 # Your output should be:


array length: 2


array: [8,6]


#note that [8, 5] would also be an acceptable answer, as it contains a length of 2 as well


If the output is not possible, then you can return the length of the array + 1 (indicating that an additional element would be needed to satisfy the requirements).

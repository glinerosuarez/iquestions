"""
We have a standard (52 card) deck of cards, with equal share of the cars associated with each of the four "suits" (e.g. clubs, spades, diamons, and hearts). You can read more about a standard card deck here.

If you draw 3 cards from the deck, one at a time, what is the probability that you draw a club, a heart, and a diamond in that order?
